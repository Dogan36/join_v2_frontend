# Join - Kanban Project Management Tool

Join is a Kanban-based project management tool designed for managing tasks and collaboration. Developed as part of a web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie, Join is a flexible, simple tool that allows users to organize their projects in workspaces and boards.

> **Note:** This is an educational project created for learning purposes. It might not be suitable for large-scale business use, but it provides an excellent base for a task management system.
